# WebDev-Portfolio

Portfolio Website

-   Course followed to design this portfolio site (as a project, or at least for the moment): https://scrimba.com/learn/portfolio by Kevil Powell
-   This is going to be a static HTML website, created with flexbox and grid.
-   Deployed and hosted on DigitalOcean.
-   Reference the design file [here](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/6ebfeb86-6eeb-4b69-77dc-ecf4c4506bcc-188e/)

## Misc Notes:

-   You must have the "alt" tag on image elements, but there doesn't NEED to be something in it. Ex. there's no need to have actual alt text for the logo image.
-   RESEARCH: what is the area-label property on a button element?
